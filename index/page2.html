            <h2>What's the Difference Between Animal Welfare and Animal Rights?</h2>
            <p>Animal welfare and animal rights are related concepts but with distinct focuses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong> Concerned with the well-being of animals and their humane treatment. It often involves regulations and standards to ensure proper care and prevent cruelty without necessarily granting animals inherent rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Rights:</strong> Advocates for granting animals certain basic rights, considering them as individuals with interests that should be respected. Animal rights go beyond welfare and aim to end practices that exploit or harm
                    animals.
                </li>
