            <h2>Cats and Dogs Rights</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pet owners are mandated to provide their pets adequate care and sustenance. Second, pet owners are vicariously liable for the damage and harm caused by their pets. Key to being a responsible pet owner is to be mindful
                of these concepts, especially because the cruel treatment of animals is punished as an offense.situation for dogs and cats varies from culture to culture. In some places, they are treated well, given scraps, even considered part of a family,
                though some may still remain outdoors and roam the streets. Sometimes they serve to guard property or control pests but are unlikely to receive veterinary care or concern for their welfare. In other communities, they are disliked, or even
                feared, and may be kicked, hit or stoned if they come too close. Although cats on the street tend to do better than dogs at fending for themselves, the lives of both species are filled with misery.

                    <li>The Animal Welfare Act: Signed into law in 1966, the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is the primary federal animal protection law. The AWA mainly involves animals kept at zoos and used in laboratories, as well as animals who are commercially
                        bred and sold like those in puppy mills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Animal Welfare Act of 1998 makes it unlawful for any person “to torture any animal, to neglect to provide adequate care, sustenance or shelter, or maltreat any animal or to subject any dog or horse to dogfights or horse fights, kill or cause or procure
                        to be tortured or deprived of adequate care, sustenance or shelter, or maltreat or use the same in research or experiments not expressly authorized by the Committee on Animal Welfare.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Article 2183 of the Civil Code where the possessor of an animal is responsible for the damage which it may cause, although it may escape or be lost. The same provision also states that this responsibility only ceases when the damage should come from force
                        majeure or when the person who has suffered damage is at fault.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Philippine Animal Welfare Act of 2013 strengthens the Animal Welfare Act of 1998 by providing stricter penalties for animal cruelty. It includes higher fines and longer imprisonment terms for offenders. The law also includes provisions
                        on responsible pet ownership, such as the requirement for pet owners to have their pets vaccinated, registered, and properly cared for. The Animal Welfare Act of 1998 is a significant law in the Philippines that aims to protect
                        the welfare of animals. It prohibits acts of cruelty towards animals, such as maltreatment, torture, killing, and neglect. The law also regulates the sale, transport, and handling of animals to ensure their welfare. Violators of
                        this law may face penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Anti-Cruelty Law is another important legislation in the Philippines that penalizes acts of cruelty to animals. It includes acts such as beating, torturing, or killing animals, as well as organizing animal fights or using animals for experimentation
                        without proper authority. The use of poison, dangerous drugs, or chemicals to kill or capture animals is also prohibited under this law.
